# SalesandInventoryDataAnalysis
The aim was to analyze the sales and inventory data for the past two months, which revealed several key insights that can guide strategic decisions regarding inventory management, sales optimization, and pricing strategies.

We have been provided with two datasets:

Sales Data: Order-level sales data covering the past 2 months, with each order containing up to 2 units sold per transaction.
Inventory Data: Inventory records showing the stock level, reorder levels, and cost price for various SKUs over the past 30 days.

Tasks:

1. Data Exploration and Cleaning

2. Key Metrics Calculation:

Calculate the Daily Run Rate for each SKU based on the sales data.
Compute the Days on Hand (DOH) for each SKU

3. SKU Performance Analysis:

Categorize SKUs into Best Sellers, Mid Sellers, and Low Sellers using their total sales

4. Stock Reorder Recommendations:

Identify which SKUs need to be reordered by comparing the current stock and reorder levels.
Create a table of SKUs with suggested reorder quantities.

5. Price Sensitivity Analysis:

Analyze how the selling price impacts the number of units sold.
Identify SKUs with high price sensitivity and provide price adjustment recommendations for at least 3.

6. Visualizations:

Create relevant charts to display key findings.
Summarize insights and trends based on the visualizations.
